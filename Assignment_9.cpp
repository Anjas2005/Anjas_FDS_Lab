// pelindrome is a string of char that is identical when read in forward 
// and backward direction typically punctuations capitalization are ignored.
// eg: "Poor dan is in a droop" is palindrome as can be seen by examinee the charachter 
// "poordanisinadroop" and observing that they are identical when read forward and backward directions 
// one way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the charachter in the string and compare them with 
// the orignal -in the string and compaere them with the orignal sewquence
// using stl library
